       --tt, ----ttrruunnccaattee--sseett11
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if --dd is not given and both SET1 and SET2 appear.  --tt may be used  only  when  translating.
       SET2  is  extended  to length of SET1 by repeating its last character as necessary.  Excess characters of SET2
       are ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to expand in ascending order;  used  in  SET2  while
       translating,  they  may only be used in pairs to specify case conversion.  --ss uses the last specified SET, and
       occurs after translation or deletion.
